# District 394 (LilyPond Score)

 A composition for 'A Cautionary Tale', a short film by Vladimir Vidanovski.

 You can listen to this composition here: soundcloud.com/jasonthomasgabriel/district-394

 You can find the [sheet music](https://github.com/jasonthomasgabriel/District-394--LilyPond-Score-/blob/main/District%20394/district-394.pdf) in the folder `District 394` as well as the LilyPond code used to engrave this. For this score I made use of my latest project: LilyPond Engraving Quickstart. To find out more, head over to its repository: github.com/jasonthomasgabriel/LilyPond-Engraving-Quickstart

> **Note:** For those wanting to run the LilyPond code, this project makes use of non-standard fonts. You will need to either instal them or comment out the include-file that calls for them. Should you want to instal them, they can be found in the folder `resources` in the root of this repository.
